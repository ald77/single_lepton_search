Single lepton search
===

This repository contains analysis software for a single lepton SUSY search.

Compilation of all code is done with compile.sh. Executables and scripts are stored in the scripts directory and are intended to be run from the root single_lepton_search directory (i.e. not from within the scripts directory).
