==========

-Adding files to allow for reduced tree production
-Code has not yet been tested
-Need to add support for 8 TeV T1tttt cross-sections, event counts, weights, etc.
-Want to add meta-data inside the same ROOT file as the reduced tree TTree (production date, reduced tree version, original file name and event count, etc.)

==========
-Fixed bug in which GetMass1/2 were unable to handle files without the "_mass1_mass2 " pattern in model_params
-Code can now produce reduced_trees which look valid, but these still need further testing. Tested on UCSB1864ra2b_v71s so far.
-Possibly suspicious behavior in tested reduced_trees: all events pass JSON cuts and I'm not sure the number of leptons distributions are good given the RA2b skim cuts are applied (need to check what cuts are included)
-Committed missing reduced_trees folder to hold data
-Added support for meta-data in ROOT file associated with reduced_trees. Contains original file name, original event count, a version tag, and production date/time.
-Started producing version 0 reduced trees of UCSB1933 (13 TeV ttbar, v71), UCSB1949 (14 TeV T1tttt, v71), and UCSB2027reshuf (13 TeV ttbar with 25 ns bunch spacing, v71) for further testing and early studies. Production done with clean checkout of last commit.
-Reminders for things I'd like to do: try MT2 to remove dilepton ttbar background (assuming this turns out to be dominant background after MT cut), plotting utility that reads in from a config file (see Manuel's for example/starting point).
